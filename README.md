Odoo on Azure with monitoring, backups to Azure Blob Storage, Key Vault for secrets, SSL, firewall, IAM, Grafana, and security best practices. I’ll target Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for all VMs (so you don’t hit “pro” image confusion) . Paste into your repo and adapt variables (resource names, domains, secrets).
